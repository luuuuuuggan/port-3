      <p>
        The theme of the project is to explore the ambiguity in human language as well as the gap between human language and computer language. We Complete the project in pairs of two, and exchange detailed descriptions of a personal object we have lost in the past with our partner. Then based on the descriptions, we re-created the objects for our partner in p5.js.

      Long time ago when I was 9, I lost stuffed animal. It is a pale aqua blue color. The body is a curved moon shape, and itâ€™s very soft and has rounded edges. It has round black eyes with white shine. The tail and fins are pointed but still rounded at the tips. It has a white/grey stomach. It is fluffy and soft. I lost it on the bus.

      <p>
     It's not an object easy to make, but I really enjoyed the process of diving the object into shapes, simplifying the way of drawing it in the language of p5js. The way I draw it on paper is totally different. This project definitely made me have a deeper understanding about the gap between human language and computer language.
